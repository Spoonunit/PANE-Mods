# PANE-Mods

The code you find here is intended to be used with the game Pharaoh: A New Era (PANE). The game is available from Steam or GOG; the code here should work with either version.

In order to use these mods, you must first setup up BepInEx within the game folder. Once done, the mods in this repository can be placed into the BepInEx/plugins folder.

Each mod has its own details and instructions. You can compile the code yourself (using Visual Studio), or look the right for 'releases', where you can download the whole set currently available pre-compiled. Once downloaded, you can pick and choose which DLLs to place in your plugins folder, or place them all in there and rename 'dll files to .dll.nope to turn individual ones off. Alternatively, BepInEx.Configuration Manager can help with configuring individual mods. Enhancements are disabled by default, Fixes are enabled.

Please feel free to raise issues, but don't expect a rapid response. You are more likely to get your issue resolved by joining in the discussion on the [PANE Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r69YzYZ).

If you wish to add your mod, fix code, or enhance documentation, please submit a pull request.
