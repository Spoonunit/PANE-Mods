# PANE-Custom_Music

This mod allows you to play custom music (e.g music from the OG) in place of the music released with the game.

## Instructions

Create a "Music" folder inside your game folder in this location:

```Pharaoh A New Era\Pharaoh_Data\Music```

Supported formats: mp3 and wav

These are the music file names the game uses, so you will need to create a file with one of the following names to replace the built-in music.

e.g. creating the file Agbj.mp3 in your custom Music folder will replace that music in-game.
